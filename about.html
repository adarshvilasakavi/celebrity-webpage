    <h2>Career</h2>
    <hr>

    <h2>2002–2011: Debut and breakthrough</h2>

      S. Rajamouli,

      Yogi and Munna, an action-drama film came out in 2007, followed by the action-comedy Bujjigadu in 2008. In 2009 his two films were Billa and Ek Niranjan. Indiaglitz called Billa stylish and visually rich.</p>
    <p>In 2010 he appeared in the romantic comedy Darling. The film opened to positive reviews. The Times of India gave a two and half star rating explaining "Director Karunakaran extracts good performances from his actors, but can't come up with
      a
      refreshing plot. It looks like the director hasn't really come
      out of his Tholi Prema hangover as he dishes out yet another one-sided love saga but fails to come up with a valid and logical reason to make a Gen Z lad to hold back his feelings for his lover until the last moment. However, he compensates
      it all, by adding loads of fun moments in the film and
      the screenplay does have its share of some touching moments."In 2011, Mr. Perfect, another romantic comedy.The review site GreatAndhra rated the film with three stars and noted "The film comes across as a clean, family entertainer and the
      intention of the makers must be appreciated.</p>

  <div class="early-life">
    <h2>2012–2014: Continued career</h2>
    <p>In 2012, Prabhas starred in Rebel, an action film directed by Raghava Lawrence. His next film was Mirchi. He rendered voice for a short cameo for the film Denikaina Ready. Sashidhar from The Times of India stated, "The film belongs to
      hard-core Prabhas fans as the movie is stylish and visually
      rich but not much in content". Purnima Ranawat from NDTV said, "Rebel serves up fare for the mass audience. The film will be definitely liked by Prabhas' fans. Watch it for the dancing talent of Tamannaah Bhatia and action skills of
      Prabhas." Radhika Rajamani from Rediff.com gave the movie
      one and half stars out of five and said, "Working with hardly any storyline, director Raghava Lawrence had made a film that is arduous to watch... Rebel is a movie for the masses and certainly not for the discerning audience."</p>
    <p>eevi of Idlebrain.com gave a rating of 3.25 out of 5, commenting that "First half of Mirchi is decent. Flashback episode which occupies 100% of second half is good. Climax could have been better. The plus points of the film are Prabhas,
      music
      and all-round orientation. On a whole, Mirchi has all
      the ingredients of a commercial potboiler". Mahesh S Koneru gave his verdict that "At the Box Office, the film will turn in a good commercial performance", giving the film a score of 3.25/5. Way2movies also gave a rating of 3.25/5,
      giving the verdict that "Prabhas rocks the show in this
      decent yet formulaic commercial entertainer". Super good movies gave the film 3 stars in a scale of 5, reviewing that "Go and Watch Mirchi, It entertains both Class and Mass. It is a worth watch." Prabhas made his Hindi cinema debut in
      2014 by doing a cameo role in the item number
      "Punjabi Mast" from the film Action Jackson.</p>
